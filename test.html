    <h2 id="home">home</h2>
    <p>Home is where the heart finds peace and comfort. It's a sanctuary filled with love, laughter, and cherished memories. Whether big or small, cozy or spacious, home represents a sense of belonging and security, where one can be themselves withoutÂ judgment.</p>
    <h2 id="Services">services</h2>
    <p> big building with many levels and apartments is called "a block of flats" (British) or an apartment building. One of the differences between a house and an apartment is that a house has a front door to the outside world, whereas the main door of an apartment usually opens onto a passage or landing that can be used by other people in the building.</p>
    <h2 id="about">about</h2>
    <p>Houses have a roof to keep off the rain and sun, and walls to keep out the wind and cold. They have window openings to let in light, and a floor. Houses of different places may look different to each other, because of different materials, climate, and styles.</p>
